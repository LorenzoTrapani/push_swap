# Introduction

The Push_swap project is part of the 42 curriculum. It involves sorting a stack of numbers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to write a program that generates the smallest number of moves to sort a given stack, optimizing both algorithmic efficiency and implementation.

# Objectives

The main objective of the project is to implement efficient sorting algorithms using stacks, applying specific operations to achieve the desired result. Youâ€™ll be expected to explore algorithmic approaches and optimize the sorting process to reduce the number of operations.
# Problem Overview

You are given two stacks: a (which contains a set of unsorted numbers) and b (initially empty). Your task is to sort the numbers in stack a using the fewest number of moves, using specific operations to manipulate the stacks.

Allowed Operations:

  - sa: Swap the first two elements at the top of stack a.
  - sb: Swap the first two elements at the top of stack b.
  - ss: Swap the first two elements at the top of both a and b.
  - pa: Push the top element from stack b onto stack a.
  - pb: Push the top element from stack a onto stack b.
  - ra: Rotate stack a upwards (the top element becomes the last).
  - rb: Rotate stack b upwards.
  - rr: Rotate both stacks a and b upwards.
  - rra: Reverse rotate stack a (the last element becomes the first).
  - rrb: Reverse rotate stack b.
  - rrr: Reverse rotate both stacks a and b.
